h2. Abstract

Cron is a Ruby class which encapsulates a repeating schedule. Objects are initialized with a "Cron expression":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#crontab_syntax. Once initialized, the object can be used to explore the schedule forwards and backwards in time.

h2. Examples

<pre>
	<code>
		>> schedule = Cron.new '0 8-17 1 * FRI'
	</code>
</pre>

creates a new Cron object which will match each hour between 8am and 5pm every Friday or 1st of the month.

<pre>
	<code>
		>> schedule.before_now
		=> Fri Nov 21 17:00:00 UTC 2008
		
		>> schedule.after_now
		=> Fri Nov 28 08:00:00 UTC 2008
		
		>> schedule.between 1.month.ago, Time.now
		=> [Fri Oct 31 08:00:00 UTC 2008, Fri Oct 31 09:00:00 UTC 2008, Fri Oct 31 10:00:00 UTC 2008 ... ]
		
				
	</code>
</pre>

Each Cron object maintains an internal reference time. This is set to the creation time time by default but can be overridden at initialization or with the time= method.

<pre>
	<code>
		>> schedule = Cron.new '0 8-17 1 * FRI', 2.months.ago
		
		>> schedule.next
		=> Fri Sep 26 08:00:00 UTC 2008
		
		>> schedule.previous
		=> Fri Sep 19 17:00:00 UTC 2008
		
		>> schedule.time = 5.months.ago

		>> schedule.previous
		=> Fri Jun 20 17:00:00 UTC 2008
	</code>
</pre>
